# Stock-Analysis

Purpose

The purpose of this entire module was to look at the performance of certain stock over the course of two years, 2017 and 2018.
The results to this will be presented later in the analysis. At the end of the module was a project where we, through a lot of
trial, error, and googling, attempted to refactor code to make it run faster. I just graduated from college and have minimal
experience in data analysis, virtually none in VBA. This was certainly the learning experienced advertised during orientation
(frustrating). In the module, specifically, we are trying to help someone's parent's investments by looking at "DQ" over time. 
This is carried over into the other "tickers" and then the final refactoring project.

Results

It is clear to say that the stock performance was fairy stronger in 2017, almost accross the entire board. TERP was the only
stock to perform porely accross both years. RUN and ENPH, however, were able to make gains in both years. DQ, the original
stock in question, actually does not seem as bad as it originally had in the module. Almost 200% return is impressive when 
compared to the rest of the table. Now, as for execution times, I actually will tell you that the numbers here do not tell
the whole story. I am actually not seeing significantly different times and at times, the un refactored code is faster. 
I do have a big, however, though. Its that my old and worn out computer that has been with me all the way through college
much prefered the refactored code, especially when running 2018's data. I have had a lot of issues with Exel not responding
and my screen would glitch out when I tried to run 2017 or 2018 in the old code. So, for grace and general compatablity with
my computer, the refactored code is very practical. 

Summary

What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code? 

Advantages: smoother transition between years, more agreeable with some computers, and easier to go in and fix (perhaps)
The first two are absolute advanteges but I feel like fiddling around with working code could be a dangerous game. The desire
for optimization may get in the way of practicality and the ability to work with and re write the code. VBA is already strange,
so you really should think before you fix what is not broken. 

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

I have kinf of already explained, the script became much more compatible with my computer and I did not have to worry about
the computer giving up on me. I would, however, wonder if it would be a big deal if more capable computers would even care 
about the diferences between the old and new script. I am not even a computer expert so perhaps they are equally disagrable. 
In conclusion, refactoring can absolutely help how the script runs but you need to do a cost benefit analysis of sorts. You
want to see if refactoring it now will create ease or trouble in the future.
